# SVM from scratch in Julia

> Done as a mini-presentation for the Topological Data Analysis course at the MiNI faculty

My notes for the presentation can be found in [notes.md](notes.md). They contain explanation of how SVMs work and derivations of needed equations.

Implementation of various SVM variations can be found in Julia files.
